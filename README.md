<h1 align="center" id="title">Serialization and Deserialization</h1>

<p id="description">Serialization is the process of converting an object into a byte stream allowing it to be easily saved to a file transmitted over a network or stored in a database. Deserialization is the reverse process where the byte stream is converted back into a copy of the object. These processes are fundamental in distributed systems data persistence and applications requiring data exchange. They are widely used in various domains such as web development data science and distributed computing.</p>
